# Algorithm Analysis

In computer science, the algorithm analysis is the determination of the computational complexity of algorithms, that is the amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to execute them.

In Algorithm Analysis, there are several subtopics I learned:
- Iterative and Recursive Algorithm in 2^n
- Binary and Linear Search
- Sorts (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.)
- Divide and Conquer Algorithm
- Tower of Hanoi
- Stable Maching Problem
- Closest Pair of Points
- Karatsuba
- Tilling Problem
- BFS and DFS
- Some topics from _Introduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition_ (Greedy Algorithm, Dynamic Programming, Minimum Spanning Trees, Shortest Paths, etc.)
