# Algorithm Analysis

In computer science, the algorithm analysis is the determination of the computational complexity of algorithms, that is the amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to execute them.

In Algorithm Analysis, there are several subtopics I learned:
1. Iterative and Recursive Algorithm in 2^n
2. Binary and Linear Search
3. Sorts (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.)
4. Divide and Conquer Algorithm
5. Tower of Hanoi
6. Stable Maching Problem
7. Closest Pair of Points
8. Karatsuba
9. Tilling Problem
10. BFS and DFS
11. Some topics from _Introduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition_ (Greedy Algorithm, Dynamic Programming, Minimum Spanning Trees, Shortest Paths, etc.)
